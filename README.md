# RelaxVR: TreeHacks2021 Project
This project was part of Stanford's TreeHacks 2021 Hackathon and was made with the help of my teammates: [Rachel Ombok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelombok/) and [Amanda Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandakim546/).

This repository is grouping all the resources that I provided to the group for our project and includes a menu and settings system for our VR experience.
Here is a video showing how these menu work and how they are used to change the environment the user wants to immerse himself in:

I am not able to include the different environments in my video as I am not the owner/creator of the assets. My involvement in the project consisted of creating menu and settings functionalities. The project can be found on [this Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/relaxvr).
